        <p>As our homes become smarter, accurately predicting what the resident is doing can make our lives easier, cheaper and healthier.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What</h3>

<p>Using data from the <a href="http://casas.wsu.edu/">CASAS</a> Project and machine learning techniques, this project accurately predicts what activity a person is engaged in based on sensor data.  The machine learning was done using <a href="http://pybrain.org/">PyBrain</a>  with a feed-forward neural network.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h3>

<p>There are many exciting opportunities if a resident's activity can be accurately predicted.  One such application is predicting power usage.  This could allow for cost savings and power consumption reduction.

The data for this project was gathered using a smart apartment (see Figure 1).  The small boxes indicate a sensor.  The ones that begin with "M" are motion sensors.  This apartment has 31 motion sensors.

<p>The sensors gathered data of real residents over the course of 39 days.  The format of the data is shown below.
</p>
<pre><code>
Date	   Time			Sensor	Value	Activity
2009-11-01 18:16:30.019905	M003	ON
2009-11-01 18:16:30.030466	M015	ON
2009-11-01 18:16:31.053482	M014	ON	Eating begin
2009-11-01 18:16:34.087702	M015	OFF
2009-11-01 18:16:36.021796	M003	OFF
2009-11-01 18:16:36.075721	M014	OFF
2009-11-01 18:16:45.071472	M003	ON
2009-11-01 18:16:46.025461	M014	ON
</code></pre>
<p>The data is parsed to extract of which sensors were triggered during a specific activity.  There are 16 unique activities indentified in this file (see Table 1).  This data is written to a file as two boolean arrays, one for the sensors and one for the activities (see example below).
</p>
<pre><code>
Input (Sensors)
0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Output (Activity)
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
</code></pre>


<p>The array of triggered sensors is the input to the neural network and the array of activities is the output.  The network was then trained over 10000 iterations with %80 of the data.
