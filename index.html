        <p>As our homes become smarter, accurately predicting what the resident is doing can make our lives easier, cheaper, and healthier.</p>


<h3>
<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What</h3>

<p>Using data from <a href="http://casas.wsu.edu/">The CASAS Project</a> and machine learning techniques, this project accurately predicts what activity a person is engaged in based on sensor data.  The machine learning was done using <a href="http://pybrain.org/">PyBrain</a>  with a feed-forward neural network.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h3>

<p>There are many exciting opportunities if a resident's activity can be accurately predicted.  One such application is predicting power usage.  This could allow for cost savings and power consumption reduction.

<a id="Dataset" class="anchor" href="#input" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dataset</h4>
<a href="http://casas.wsu.edu/">The CASAS Project</a> conducts research using several different smart apartments outfitted with a variety of sensors.  Then, real people live the apartment for an extended period of time. Figure 1 shows the layout of the apartment for the <a href = "http://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/tulum2.zip">data</a> used in this project.  The small boxes indicate a sensor.  The ones that begin with "M" are motion sensors and those that begin with "T" are temperature sensors.  This apartment has 31 motion sensors.

<p>The data was gathered over 152 days and 12637 activities were recorded.  The format of the data is shown below.

<p>The data is parsed to extract which sensors were triggered during a specific activity.  There are 16 unique activities indentified in this file (see Table 1).  This data is written to a file as two boolean arrays, one for the sensors and one for the activities (see example below).  These arrays are the input to the neural network.

<a id="NeuralNetwork" class="anchor" href="#input" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building and Training the Neural Network</h4>

<p>The neural network was built using <bold>8 hidden layers.</bold>  The array of triggered sensors is the input to the neural network and the array of activities is the output.  The network was then trained over 10000 iterations with %80 of the data (See Figure 2).  The network was trained using backpropagation.

<a id="Results" class="anchor" href="#input" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results</h4>
<p>After training, the neural network was tested with the other %20 of the dataset.  Sample output from the neural network is shown below. </p>

<pre><code>
('out:    ', '[0.007 , -0.006, -0.003, -0.001, 0.018 , 0.024 , -0.005
, 0.042 , -0.037, 0.106 , 0.022 , 0.067 , 0.011 , -0.001, 0.789 , -0.031]')
('correct:', '[0     , 0     , 0     , 0     , 0     , 0     , 0     
, 0     , 0     , 0     , 0     , 0     , 0     , 0     , 1     , 0     ]')
error:  0.03291553
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the prediction of the neural network, the second line is the correct output.  To evaluate the neural network, I took the largest value from its output and compared it with the correct response.  The neural network correctly predicted the activity <bold>%52.35<bold> of the time.  I also evaluated the output by checking to see if the correct output was one of the top two predicted by the neural network.  The neural network correctly narrowed it down to 2 of the 16 activities %100 of the time.
</p>

<p>To visualize where the neural network was picking the wrong response, I created a confusion matrix (see Figure 3)
