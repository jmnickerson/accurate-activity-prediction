The machine learning was done using [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/)  with a feed-forward neural network.\r\n\r\n[Video](https://youtu.be/EvIqcDkBsAM)\r\n### Quick Facts\r\n- ~12000 data points\r\n- 8 Hidden Layer Neural Network\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nThere are many exciting opportunities if a resident's activity can be accurately predicted.  One such application is predicting power usage.  This could allow for cost savings and power consumption reduction.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
